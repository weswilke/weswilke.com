		This site is in a CMS called Kentico which is .NET based.  It incorporates HTML5 audio and video as well as small CSS3 animations.  The desktop-only design 
		was built to provide an immersive full-screen experience.  Notice the full-screen page transitions and subtle effects provided by the dotted swirls that dance as you move your mouse.
